# 1. Write a program that prints out the results of the following statments:
#   1 == 3
#   4 <= 4
#   "a" == "a"
#   10 > 11
#   "b" > "c"
print("***1***")

print(1 == 3)
print(4 <= 4)
print("a" == "a")
print(10 > 11)
print("b" > "c")

# 2. Write a program that assigns the variable "my_number" any number of your choice. And prints out the results of any comparrison with 3 different numbers of your choosing.
print("***2***")

my_number = 4
print(my_number <= 20)
print(my_number != 4)
print(my_number < 450)


# 3.Write a program that assigns the varaible "name" a string.
# Create an if statement that compares the value of "name" to another string that has the same value of "name", and if it is the same print "YES these strings are the same!"
# Create another if statement that compares the value of "name" with a string that does not have the same value, and if it does not have the same value print "NO These strings are different!"
print("***3***")

name = "It's a Tuesday!"

if name == "It's a Tuesday!":
    print("YES, these strings are the same!")

if name != "It's a Monday!":
    print("NO, these strings are different!")
